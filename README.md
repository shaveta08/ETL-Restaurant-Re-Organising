# Restaurant-Reorganising

## Project Proposal:

A Company owning multiple restaurants require a ETL expert to reorganise the data they have collected for the last year. 
The company have managed the data into multiple csv files so far. They want the ETL expert to transform the data into meaningful Tables and store the whole data in 
a single database. So I am going to help them manage their data and try making the whole process automated, which would ultimately help them to make analytical decisions using the transformed data stored in the database.

### Data Source (Extract) :
Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/restaurant-data-with-consumer-ratings?select=chefmozaccepts.csv)

### Transform:
Pandas and jupyter notebooks

### Final Database(Load) : 
In form of Tables
